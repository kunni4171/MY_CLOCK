        No matter what you're going through, there's a light at the end of the
        tunnel and it may seem hard to get to it but you can do it and just keep
        working towards it and you'll find the positive side of things.

        Work hard for what you want because it won't come to you without a
        fight. You have to be strong and courageous and know that you can do
        anything you put your mind to.
